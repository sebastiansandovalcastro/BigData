##What is pair programming?
The method known as pair programming is used primarily in agile software development and, more specifically, in extreme programming (XP). The programming pair specifies that there are always two people working on code at the same time and that they sit together as much as possible. One is in charge of writing the code and the other of supervising it in real time. At the same time, they are constantly exchanging impressions: they discuss problems, find solutions and develop creative ideas.

##Advantages of pair programming
Working as a couple within the framework of a project, whether it involves scheduling or another procedure, carries with it many advantages. In general, four eyes see much more than just two: the pair programming method minimizes the risk of errors. While one person writes the code, the other visualizes it and concentrates only on finding errors. In general, it is quite difficult for us to detect the errors themselves. It is usually our colleagues who detect them most quickly.

##Summary
The programming pair method can lighten the software development process. However, to be able to benefit from the advantages of this method, you need resources and the willingness to work as a couple in a constructive way.
