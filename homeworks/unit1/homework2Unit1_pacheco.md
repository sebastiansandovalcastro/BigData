## What is Pearson's correlation coefficient?
Pearson's correlation coefficient is a test that measures the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. If the association between the elements is not linear, then the coefficient is not adequately represented.

The correlation coefficient can take a range of values ​​from +1 to -1. A value of 0 indicates that there is no association between the two variables. A value greater than 0 indicates a positive association. That is, as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other. A value less than 0 indicates a negative association; that is, as the value of one variable increases, the value of the other decreases.

To carry out the Pearson correlation it is necessary to fulfill the following:

The measurement scale must be an interval or ratio scale.
The variables must be roughly distributed.
The association must be linear.
There should be no outliers in the data.

## Advantages and disadvantages of the Pearson correlation coefficient
Among the main advantages of the Karl Pearson correlation coefficient are:

The value is independent of whatever unit is used to measure the variables.
If the sample is large, the accuracy of the estimate is more likely.

Some of the disadvantages of the correlation coefficient are:

The two variables need to be measured at a continuous quantitative level.
The distribution of the variables must be similar to the normal curve.


## Interpretation of the Karl Pearson correlation coefficient
Pearson's correlation coefficient has the objective of indicating how associated two variables are with each other, therefore:

## Correlation less than zero: 
If the correlation is less than zero, it means that it is negative, that is, that the variables are inversely related.

When the value of some variable is high, the value of the other variable is low. The closer it is to -1, the clearer the extreme covariance. If the coefficient is equal to -1, we mean a perfect negative correlation.

## Correlation greater than zero: 
If the correlation is equal to +1 it means that it is perfect positive. In this case it means that the correlation is positive, that is, that the variables are directly correlated.

When the value of one variable is high, the value of the other is also high, the same happens when they are low. If it is close to +1, the coefficient will be the covariance.

## Correlation equal to zero: 
When the correlation is equal to zero it means that it is not possible to determine any sense of covariation. However, it does not mean that there is no nonlinear relationship between the variables.
